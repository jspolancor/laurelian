## Kowloon

I've always been obessed with the strange walled city of Kowloon, the most densely populated city on earth's history.

A square mile apartment blocks with 350 buildings, almost all between 10 and 14 stories high, occupied by 8,500 premises, 10.700 households, and more than 33.000 residents.

The city’s many tall, narrow tower blocks were packed tight against each other—so tight as to make the whole place seem like one massive structure: part architecture, part organism. There was little uniformity of shape, height, or building material.

All buildings and apartments were created almost randomly, without following any rule or structure, each one completely different and autentic, creating a concrete labyrinth, full of secrets, and hiding places.

I've always wondered how every apartment in Kowloon looked like in the inside, what kind of people lived there, how did they spend their time, what kind of polytics ruled the city, I started imagining every little story and created my own Kowloon building.

## The Kowloon building

The Kowloon building is a series of NFT's that together make one monster building.

Every piece represents an apartment, the Kowloon building will have 100 apartments. All apartmens have a story and details hidden in every corner, and the building have a story that connects all pieces as a whole.

Every time you collect a Kowloon apartment you will add it to you own building (your collection), all apartments can be stacked together and interact with each other, the more apartments you own the bigger and more complex your building becomes.

All apartments have a story, and there's a global story hidden in all apartments, that story could change everytime the apartments get rearranged.

I will create one or two apartments every week, the whole building is going to take more than a year to build.

## The cornerstone

This post is the cornerstone of the Kowloon building.
